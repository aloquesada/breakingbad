# Post Exercise Notes

## Missing Requirements

1. Episode filtering by season

## Known bugs

1. The sorting buttons aren't highlighted when one is active
2. When more characters are added, they are not sorted when needed


## Things I would add
1. Refactor axios as a service to avoid the repeated code in every component
2. Tags for certain information (i.e. The occupation appears, but there's no text saying ocupation)
3. Fully Responsive behavior
4. Footer
5. Loading spinners
6. Separated stylesheets for each component
7. Shadows and animations
8. Site identification (favicon, title)
9. More iconography
